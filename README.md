# Car-Accidents-Predictions
Road Accidents in France
==============================

**Context of project**:

● **Technical Perspective**

Integrating a predictive model to forecast the number of lightly or heavily injured individuals at an accident site requires a robust technical framework. This model will be developed using advanced machine learning algorithms, leveraging historical data on accidents, its circumstances and injuries..

● **Economic Perspective**

From an economic standpoint, this project aims to optimize resource allocation in emergency response scenarios. By accurately predicting the severity and number of injuries, police and ambulance services can deploy an appropriate number of personnel and vehicles, reducing unnecessary operational costs and ensuring that resources are available for other emergencies. The initial investment in technology and data infrastructure is anticipated to be offset by long-term savings and efficiency gains. Moreover, the potential to improve response times and outcomes may lead to increased public trust and support, possibly translating into better funding opportunities and partnerships.
